Adafruit_mfGFX_Library
======================

Multifont version of Adafruit_GFX library with Adafruit SSD1351 Display drivers and demo.

This library supports any compatible Adafruit_GFX display driver.  The free TheDotFactory Windows program is recommended for created data compatible with the Adafruit_mfGFX library.

Please see the README.pdf files for instructions on creating and adding new fonts.  The base library comes with 4 fonts and a "test" font so new candidate font data can easily be added and tested before being permanently added to the library.

BE AWARE that though font data does not take up Spark RAM, they do however take up flash space so having too many fonts may prove problematic.

** UPDATED with font compilation option, June 2014


This is a library for the 1.27" & 1.5" 16-bit Color OLED with SSD1351 driver chip
